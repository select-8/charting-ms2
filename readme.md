# INTERACTIVE FRONT END MILESTONE PROJECT

## Charting Data From an EU Developer Survey

## Project Overview

The project presented here consists of a series of interactive graphs and charts. They are rendered in SVG by D3.js, charted using the DC.js charting library and made multidimentially intercative by the crossfilter.js JavaScript library. 

The goals of this project are to:

 - design a single webpage project, which through the use of charts and graphs, communicates something useful about the underlying data to the user of the site.
 - to use JavaScript to accomplish this, and in so doing, to begin to learn something about how I as a developer can use JavaScript in my professional career.
 - to firm up and build upon the knowlegdge of HTML and CSS I gathered from the first milestone project, and to understand how JavaScript can be used to enhance those languages.
- to understand how I can begin to use data to drive intercative visualisations.
- to begin to use some common JavaScript libraries such as jQuery.
- to begin to understand the nomenclature of JavaScript.
